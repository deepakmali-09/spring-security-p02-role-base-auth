# Role-Based Authentication with Spring Security

This project is a simple implementation of **Role-Based Authentication** using **Spring Security**. It demonstrates how to secure endpoints based on user roles and implement user authentication and authorization effectively.

---

## Features

- User authentication with username and password.
- Role-based access control (e.g., `ADMIN`, `USER`, etc.).
- Secured endpoints accessible only by authorized roles.
- Basic user data stored in memory for simplicity (can be replaced with a database).
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) implementation for authentication (if applicable).

---

## Tech Stack

- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for application setup and configurations.
- **Spring Security**: Security framework for authentication and authorization.
- **Maven**: Build tool for managing dependencies and project lifecycle.
- **Postman** (optional): For testing API endpoints.

## How to Test

1. Use Postman or a similar tool to test API endpoints.
2. Login with valid credentials to receive a token.
